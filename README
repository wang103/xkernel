data_struct/:   Built-in data structures
kernel/:        Core subsystems
scripts/:       Various scripts used for building stuffs


To Compile:
Simply type 'make' to compile the kernel sources. This will
output the binary kernel 'xkernel' in ELF format.

The kernel can be loaded using GRUB, and run using emulator.
If you have qemu installed, you can start the kernel by
'make run'.


To Debug:
In one console, do 'make test_qemu' to start qemu, which
will wait for a gdb connection. In another console, do
'make test_gdb', then type 'target remote localhost:1234'
to start debugging.
